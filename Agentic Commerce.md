**Agentic Commerce — Automate the process of finding and buying things online** 

VC Track

---

## **1\. Goals / Motivation**

**Do you know that feeling of jumping from website to website, comparing prices, delivery times, and options — and then doing checkout after checkout?**  
We hate it too.

Whether you’re planning a party, buying an outfit, or organizing an event, online shopping today is:

* fragmented  
* time-consuming  
* repetitive  
* and unnecessarily complex

Search engines help you *find* products — but they don’t help you **get everything bought**.

**Goal:** Build a conversational, agentic shopping experience that lets users describe *what they want* — and delegates the entire buying process to an AI agent.

**Goal**

Create an AI agent that can:

1. Understand a high-level shopping intent  
2. Break it down into concrete shopping needs  
3. Discover and rank products across **multiple retailers**  
4. Create a **single, combined cart**  
5. Orchestrate a **cross-store checkout flow** (simulated / sandboxed)

This is not a recommendation chatbot.  
This is **end-to-end agentic commerce**.

Choose **one** scenario to keep the scope feasible in 24 hours.

**Option A: Super Bowl Party Outfit**

“I need a full outfit (head-to-toe) in team style, budget $150, delivered by Friday.”

**Option B: Skiing Outfit**

“Downhill skiing outfit, warm and waterproof, size M, budget $400, delivery within 5 days.”

**Option C: Hackathon Host Kit**

“I’m hosting a hackathon for 60 people — figure out what I need (snacks, badges, adapters, decorations, prizes) and buy it at the best price.”

## **2\. Features**

**2.1 Conversational Brief & Constraints Capture**

The agent must capture:

* Budget  
* Delivery deadline  
* Preferences (style, size, brand, color)  
* Must-haves vs nice-to-haves

Output: a **structured shopping spec** (e.g. JSON).

**2.2 Multi-Retailer Discovery (≥ 3 retailers)**

The agent must source products from **at least three different retailers**, using:

* real product data, or  
* mocked retailer APIs with realistic data

Each item must include:

* price  
* delivery estimate  
* variants  
* retailer identity

**2.3 Ranking Engine (Not Just LLM Output)**

Products must be ranked using a **transparent scoring logic**, e.g.:

* total cost  
* delivery feasibility  
* preference match  
* set coherence

The agent must explain:

“Why is this option ranked \#1?”

**2.4 Single Combined Cart View**

Build a cart that:

* combines items from multiple retailers  
* shows total cost and delivery per item  
* allows easy replacement or optimization

**2.5 Checkout Orchestration (Safe Demo)**

No real purchases required.

Allowed:

* simulated checkout with form-fill replay  
* sandbox checkout \+ mocks  
* step-by-step checkout plan with autofill preview

Must show:

* payment \+ address entered once  
* agent fans out checkout steps per retailer (simulated)

**3\. Constraints (Very Important)**

* No simple recommendation chatbot  
* No single-retailer solution  
* Combined cart UI is required  
* At least 3 retailers  
* Checkout must be simulated or sandboxed  
* User can modify the cart and the agent adapts

**4\. Optional Extensions (Stretch Goals)**

 Budget optimizer (“same setup, cheaper”)  
 Delivery optimizer (“everything arrives by Friday”)  
 Style or category coherence  
 Return-aware ranking  
 Explain mode (decision trace)

## **4\. Why Does It Matter?**

The future of commerce isn’t more filters or better search.  
It’s **delegation**.  
This challenge explores a world where:

* users describe outcomes, not SKUs  
* AI handles the complexity  
* and buying becomes a single, coherent experience
